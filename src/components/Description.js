            I've always been fascinated by technology, which led me to pursue a
            Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the{" "}
            <b>University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez</b>. Currently, I work as an{" "}
            <b>Associate Software Engineer</b> at <b>Lockheed Martin</b>,
            specializing in <b>C++ development</b> and <b>systems design</b>,
            with experience in software development for <b>embedded systems</b>.
            I also mentor new hires, reviewing their code and guiding them to
            integrate smoothly into the team while adhering to coding standards.
